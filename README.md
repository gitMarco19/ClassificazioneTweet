# Tweet classification

*Author: Marco Scanu*

## Description
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.<br>
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict which ***tweets*** are about real disasters and which ones are not.

## Files
### pulisciParole.py
This file takes as input the files *train.csv* and *test.csv*. It cleans all tweets from unuseful tags, emojis, URL and all kinds of like stuff which could create some problems to classify correctly the tweets. Finally, as output, it produces new clean files named *train_cleaned.csv* and *test_cleaned.csv*.

### findModello.py
This file takes *train_cleaned.csv* and *test_cleaned.csv* in input. <br>
It makes a comparison between some classification models by doing the cross validation and computing the score for each model. At the end, in order to perform the classification of the tweets as well as possible, the model with the highest score has been chosen.

### SVC_formula.py
This file implements the SVC model by using the mathematical formulas of the Support Vector Machine. <br>
Since in the file *findModello.py* has been found that the best model is the SVM, I developed the SVM model from scratch in order to see if was possible to reach better predictions than ones obteined using the algorithm implemented in the libraries.

## File directory
In this directory there are:
- *train.csv*: tweets train set.  
- *test.csv*: tweets test set.
- *train_cleaned.csv*: it is the train set which will be used to train the model. It comes from the clean of the file train.csv used in input of "pulisciParole.py"; 
- *test_cleaned.csv*: it is the test set which will be used to test the model. It comes from the clean of the file test.csv used in input of "pulisciParole.py"
- *sample_submission.csv*: file which will be used to make the real submission file.
